SYSTEM_PERSONA = (
    "You are an expert Staff-level Software Engineer and AI Architect acting as a Socratic system design coach. "
    "Your goal is to guide the user from a high-level idea to a well-defined set of system requirements. "
    "You MUST NOT provide direct answers or solutions. Instead, you MUST ask probing, open-ended questions "
    "to help the user think through all critical aspects of system design. "
    "Your tone is professional, encouraging, and collaborative. "
    "You will guide the user through a series of phases. In each phase, ask the specified questions. "
    "Base your follow-up questions on the user's responses to dig deeper."
)

ROUTER_PROMPT = (
    "You are an expert at routing user requests in a system design discussion. "
    "Based on the user's last message, determine the next step. "
    "The user can use commands like [next], [back], [summarize], or [end]. "
    "If no explicit command is given, the user is likely still discussing the current topic. "
    "Your available choices are: 'vision_and_scoping', 'functional_requirements', "
    "'data_model', 'nfr_and_scale', 'architecture_and_components', 'deep_dive_and_tradeoffs', 'summarize', or 'end'.\n\n"
    "Current Phase: {current_phase}\n"
    "User's last message: '{user_command}'\n\n"
    "Respond with ONLY the name of the next appropriate choice. For example, if the user says '[next]', and the current phase is 'vision_and_scoping', you should respond with 'functional_requirements'."
)

# --- Phase-specific Prompts ---

VISION_AND_SCOPING_PROMPT = (
    "Let's begin with the big picture. To build a solid foundation, we need to understand the 'why' behind this project.\n\n"
    "First, what is the core problem you're aiming to solve? Who are your primary users, and what are their biggest pain points that this system will address?\n\n"
    "Next, what are the absolute, must-have outcomes for a version 1? Think about the minimum viable product (MVP) that delivers real value.\n\n"
    "Finally, let's talk about constraints. Are there any hard limits on budget, timeline, team expertise, or required use of existing company infrastructure?"
)

FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS_PROMPT = (
    "Great, we have a clear vision. Now, let's detail *what* the system will do. Let's define the functional requirements.\n\n"
    "Could you describe the key user journeys? For example, walk me through the steps a user would take to accomplish their main goal, from start to finish.\n\n"
    "Can you list the core features as user stories? The format 'As a [user type], I can [perform an action] so that [I get this benefit]' is very helpful.\n\n"
    "Will this system expose an API for other services or clients? If so, what are the crucial endpoints you envision, such as `POST /users` or `GET /products/{id}`?"
)

DATA_MODEL_PROMPT = (
    "Excellent. With the functionality defined, let's focus on the dataâ€”the lifeblood of the system.\n\n"
    "What are the fundamental entities or 'nouns' in your system? Think about core concepts like 'User', 'Product', 'Order', 'Document', etc.\n\n"
    "How do these entities relate to each other? Is it one-to-many (a User has many Orders), many-to-many (a Product can be in many Categories)?\n\n"
    "What kind of data will you store for each entity? Is it highly structured like a user profile, semi-structured like a JSON document, or unstructured like a full blog post or image?\n\n"
    "Crucially, let's consider the access patterns. Will your system be read-heavy (like a news site), write-heavy (like a logging service), or balanced?"
)

NFR_AND_SCALE_PROMPT = (
    "Now let's discuss the non-functional requirements (NFRs), which define the system's quality and scalability.\n\n"
    "Let's do a 'back-of-the-envelope' scale estimation. How many daily active users and requests per second are you targeting at launch, and then in one year?\n\n"
    "- **Latency:** What is an acceptable response time for your users? For example, should 95% of requests complete in under 200ms?\n"
    "- **Availability:** How critical is uptime? Are you aiming for 'three nines' (99.9% uptime, ~8.7h downtime/year), 'four nines' (99.99%, ~52m downtime/year), or is less availability acceptable initially?\n"
    "- **Consistency:** If data is written to the system, does it need to be readable by everyone instantly (strong consistency), or is a small delay acceptable (eventual consistency)?"
)

ARCHITECTURE_AND_COMPONENTS_PROMPT = (
    "With a clear picture of the requirements, let's start sketching a high-level architectural blueprint.\n\n"
    "Let's think in terms of major building blocks. We will almost certainly need:\n"
    "- A **Client-Facing Interface** (e.g., Web Server, API Gateway)\n"
    "- The **Core Business Logic** (e.g., Application Server or Serverless Functions)\n"
    "- A **Primary Data Store** (e.g., Database)\n\n"
    "What other supporting services do you foresee? Consider components for:\n"
    "- **Traffic Management** (Load Balancers)\n"
    "- **Performance** (Caches)\n"
    "- **Asynchronous Communication** (Message Queues, Event Buses)\n"
    "- **User Identity** (Authentication/Authorization Service)\n"
    "- **Intensive Tasks** (Background Workers)"
)

DEEP_DIVE_AND_TRADEOFFS_PROMPT = (
    "This architecture looks promising. The true mark of a great design is understanding its trade-offs. Let's challenge some of our assumptions.\n\n"
    "Let's pick a key component we've discussed, like the database. If you were thinking of a relational SQL database, what are the pros and cons of that choice versus a NoSQL alternative (like a document, key-value, or graph store) for this specific use case?\n\n"
    "Now consider how our services will communicate. What are the trade-offs between using synchronous APIs (like REST or gRPC) versus adopting an asynchronous, event-driven pattern for your system's core workflows? When would one be clearly better than the other?"
)

SUMMARY_PROMPT = (
    "We've covered a lot of ground. I will now synthesize our entire discussion, from vision to trade-offs, into a consolidated system design document. "
    "Please review it and let me know if there are any gaps or misinterpretations.\n\n"
    "Here is the summary of your system design based on our conversation:\n\n"
    "{design_document}"
